# Searching
Linear search and Binary search
Explanation:

Sequential (Linear) Search: It checks each element one by one in the array until the desired element (key) is found or the end of the array is reached.

Binary search: This algorithm works on sorted arrays. It divides the array into halves, checking the middle element, and adjusts the search range based on whether the key is smaller or larger than the middle element.
